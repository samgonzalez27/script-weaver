# Project Vision &mdash; ScriptWeaver

ScriptWeaver is a deterministic task-execution engine designed to make complex build, data, and automation workflows **predictable, auditable, and replayable**.

The system guarantees that:

- The same inputs always produce the same outputs
- Execution decisions are explicit and traceable
- Partial failures can be resumed safely without re-executing completed work

ScriptWeaver prioritizes **correctness, determinism, and transparency** over convenience.

It is not a general-purpose workflow orchestrator.

It is a **deterministic execution substrate** intended for developers and systems that require trustable results.
